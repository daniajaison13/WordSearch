# WordSearch
A word search game where players search for hidden words in a grid of letters. The game can include different categories and difficulty levels, making it suitable for players of all ages.
The primary objective of this project is to develop a web-based straightforward Word Search game.

### Milestones with Deadlines:
Week 1: Basic grid generation and word placement algorithm implemented 
Week 2: Flask integration for basic UI setup
Week 3: Category selection and difficulty levels implemented
Week 4: Integrate backend and frontend
Week 5: Final testing and bug fixing

### Technologies Used:
Front-end: React, Node
Back-end: Flask, Python
Database: MongoDB Atlas cloud
Algorithms/AI Schemes:
Grid Generation: Generate a grid of letters with rows and columns. Randomly select letters to fill the grid.

### Word Placement Algorithm: Use techniques such as backtracking to strategically place hidden words. Ensure words intersect and do not conflict with each other or violate constraints.

###Market Space and Selling Points:
The application targets users of all ages who enjoy puzzle games.
Selling points include multiple categories, varying difficulty levels, and an intuitive user interface.
