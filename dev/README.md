# Word Search Game

The primary objective of this project is to develop a web-based straightforward Word Search game.

In constructing the Word Search Game, we leveraged React and Node.js for the frontend client, while Flask was utilized for the backend server with RESTful API deployed for communication. All data was preserved in the MongoDB Atlas cloud.
